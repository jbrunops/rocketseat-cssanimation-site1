<b>
In this project, I developed a website using various front-end technologies and techniques. Here are the key learnings:

- HTML: Structured the page content using HTML5, ensuring proper semantics and accessibility.

- CSS: Styled the page with CSS3, applying animations, CSS variables, and complex layouts using Flexbox and Grid.

- Sass/Less: Utilized a CSS preprocessor to facilitate maintenance and organization of the code, taking advantage of features like selector nesting and variables.

- Google Fonts: Implemented custom fonts using Google's font service to enhance the site's typography.

- CSS Animations: Created smooth and interactive animations for page elements, such as the photo gallery and header, providing a visually appealing experience.

One of the most interesting parts of this project was creating an interactive photo gallery that uses CSS Grid for a responsive layout and CSS animations for smooth transitions. This project allowed me to deepen my front-end knowledge and improve my skills in creating dynamic and responsive interfaces.
